<hr>

Use the Sample - Superstore.xlsx data set to answer the questions below:

**1. What are the top 10 products in Appliances sub-category?**


**2. Order of Operations in Tableau (read and discuss with the team)**

The order of operations in Tableau, sometimes called the query pipeline, is the order in which Tableau performs various actions. Actions are also known as operations. Many operations apply filters, which means that as you build a view and add filters, those filters always execute in the order established by the order of operations.

Sometimes, you might expect Tableau to execute filters in one order, but the order of operations dictates that they be executed in a different order, which gives you unexpected results. When this happens, you can sometimes change the order in which operations are executed in the pipeline.
The Tableau order of operations includes the following, from top to bottom.
