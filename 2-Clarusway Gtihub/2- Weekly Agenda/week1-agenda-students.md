- Personal Questions (Stay at home & Corona, Study Environment, Kids etc.) 
- Any challenges (Classes, Coding, studying, etc.) 
- How you’re studying, you need personal advice? 
- Remember that practice makes perfect. 
- What exactly each student does for the team, if they know each other, if they care for each other, if they follow and talk with each other etc.

**3. What is sampling? Why do we need it?**

<br>

**4. What is an outlier? Explain how you might screen for outliers and what would you do if you found them in your dataset.**

- [Data Analysis with Python
Project - 1 (Police Stops in Traffic)](https://github.com/clarusway/clarusway-ds-students-7-21/tree/main/1-%20Projects/01-EU_DS_DAPy_M1-(TrafficPoliceStops)) <br>

You will practice fixing data types, handling missing values, and dropping columns and rows while learning about the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.

You'll be analyzing a dataset of traffic stops in Rhode Island that was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project.

You'll find the instructions and information that you need in Jupyter Notebook files. There are also two datasets provided that you will use.

There are four chapters (each contains different Data Analysis instructions) that you need to complete.

Some parts of the chapter third require Data Visualization codes. These parts can be completed after Data Visualization with Python lessons.

Clone/Download these files and work on your local, then push your solutions (.ipynb files) up to your GitHub repository.
